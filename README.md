# Salifort Motors employee retention data project
#### Featuring comprehensive EDA and feature tuning to create optimized decision tree and random forest models

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create data-driven models to improve employee satisfaction. This data includes features such as satisfaction from 0 to 1, number of projects, average work hours per month, time spent at the company, and whether the employee left the company. The best random forest model reached an accuracy of 96.16% with a precision of 87.04%, with feature evaluation showing that metrics such as time since the employee's last evaluation, number of projects, and tenure affected whether an employee left or not the most.

# Business Understanding 

The importance of these models to stakeholders is mainly the insights into what factors can improve employee satisfaction and increase retention regardless of the employee. The models can serve as predictors as to how Salifort Motors can improve their work environment.

# Data Understanding 

The Salifort Motors dataset comes from a fictional company, but the data mirrors real-world employee satisfaction metrics. Some limitations of the dataset include quite a few outliers for tenure that represent founders or higher management, whereas the majority of employees have only been hired a few years. 

Some insights about satisfaction found during EDA include a few centralized groups of employees leaving who were either unsatisfied, or satisfied and overworked. Also, ratios between employees leaving and staying were similar across all 10 departments, indicating company-wide trends. However, finding disproportionate ratios could indicate problems in a certain department or with managers.
